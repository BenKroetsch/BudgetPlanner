<h3>My Personal Project: Budgeting Tracker Program</h3>

As a second year student who recently moved out, budgeting and spending responsibly is important.
Without carefully tracking my spending, it is quite easy to go over my budget without even realizing. 
It is annoying and tedious to manually add up finances. Often this task prevents me from ever attempting
to setting goals because it is time-consuming and boring. Thus, an 
application that could streamline these issues would be useful to not only me but other students and individuals
looking to easily stay on top of their spending. 
My project will be a *budgeting tracker* that allows multiple separate
users to monitor their weekly and monthly finances. Users will be able to set personal goals 
for their overall weekly budget and each category of spending.
From there, users simply add there expenses according to the category and the program will automatically
sort and calculate their weekly performance. The user will have access to a number of analytical tools
to ensure they stack on track of their expenses.

**A list of features:**
- set weekly goals according to categories of spending
- add expenses according to category of spending
- view budget left for both week and month
- view weekly spending habits and using visual tools (graph and pi charts) 
- view week to week comparisons using visual tools
- see if you are projected to make the monthly budget
- allows for multiple separate users
- save reoccurring payments (ex. monthly rent)
