My Personal Project: Budgeting Tracker Program
As a second year student who recently moved out, budgeting and spending
responsibly is important. Without carefully tracking my spending, it is 
quite easy to go over my budget without even realizing. It is annoying and 
tedious to manually add up finances. Often this task prevents me from ever 
attempting to set spending goals. Thus, 
an application that could solve these issues would be useful to not only 
me but other students and individuals looking to easily stay on top of their 
spending. My project will be a budgeting tracker that allows 
users to monitor their and monthly finances. Users will be able to set 
personal goals for their monthly budget.
From there, users simply add there expenses according to the category and the program
will automatically sort and calculate their weekly performance. The user will
have access to a number of analytical tools to ensure they stack on track of their expenses.
